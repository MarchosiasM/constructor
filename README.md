# An Exercise in Constructors

Two layers abstraction of simple constructors. index.js references Word.js which references Letter.js. The result is an Adventure Time themed phrase guessing game. When the game starts up you'll be prompted to begin guessing at letters in the phrase. With each correct guess the position of the letters will be revealed and with each incorrect guess you'll be notified of how many incorrect guesses you have left (starting with 7).

## Getting Started

This should run simply by copying these files to a directory, then using `npm install` to acquire the `inquirer` module needed to run it. Then, from the command line use node to launch `index.js`
